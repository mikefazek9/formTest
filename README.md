# FETCH FORM

## Overview

In this project I created, a simple form application using React.JS, Validator from NPM and TailwindCSS for styling.

- Created Input fields
- Used Validator for Email input
- Styled using TailwindCSS

### Application information

- GET request from API given
- POST user input to Network Payload (name, email, password, occupation, state)
- Requires User to use correct input fields, Will not submit form if a field is empty
- Validates each field
- onSubmit shows success or failed Message

### If I had more time

- completed better styling and use a Mock design example
- added Icons to valdation and change colors depending on success or failed message
- extract some longer components into smaller ones
